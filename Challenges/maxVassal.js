/*
Given an integer number num, calculate the value of its maximum vassal. Number k is considered to be a vassal of num if:

k > 0;
k3 < num;
k3 has non-trivial divisors in common with num.
Example

For num = 42, the output should be
maxVassal(num) = 3.

33 = 27, and gcd(27, 42) = 3, so 3 is a vassal of 42. It's also the maximum one, since 43 = 64 â‰¥ 42.

      if(num%j == 0 && j*j*j <= num && i%j == 0){
        return i
